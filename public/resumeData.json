    "bio": "I would describe myself as an analytical, technical minded developer who likes challenges. I have a deep interest in blockchain technology and applications. I'm a team player with a winner mentality who always gets along with other people. Writing code in a qualitative, efficient way is one of my focus points. Python is my main programming language, but I am always eager to learn new technologies. Being adaptive to new situations and thinking analytically are not a problem. Besides coding, I like to do some sports: playing some football or going for a run. If mental exercise counts as sports, you can add chess to that list as well (as the background probably gave away :) ).",
    "whyHiring": "The profile of a developer with a background in blockchain, mathematics and economics is not the most common, so if you're looking for this profile you are probably looking in the right place. Having worked at Deloitte, I have been in client-facing functions as well. I focus on delivering high quality code and am constantly trying to improve myself. I am a team player. I am willing to go the extra mile. I am good at working towards goals. The downside of my profile? You can't be or know everything: I'm not a pure theoretical mathematician, the most experienced full-stack developer, smooth sales man or economist, I'm a mix of these profiles. As a consequence, you probably won't be able to tick off all the boxes you are looking for. This scares of a lot of people. Which I understand. I can only tell you that I am a fast learner and that you will not regret having me on your team on the long run.",

After taking multiple statistical courses, I also did my thesis about statistics (studying statistical techniques to determine the effect of a treatment for the group that is actually treated). The methods where scripted and tested in R and the paper written in Latex. At the end of my math studies, I also did a six-week internship in the algorithms team of BE-Mobile. Here I worked on an algorithm to detect blocked roads in a traffic modelling application. The programming language used was Go, QGIS visualized the traffic data and Git (Bitbucket) was the version control tool."

I learned developing and integrating blockchain platforms as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, but also gained general experience in cryptography and programming languages as Go, Javascript (Node, React) and even Arduino."

        "description": "After his studies, Kasper joined Deloitte in the analytics and information management as a business analyst in September 2017 (with a brief pause in the end of 2017 to complete his Master diploma). In his first year at Deloitte, he mainly created data models using IBM Planning Analytics and SQL Server in corporate environments. This included working closely together with clients to translate business requirements into a technical solution, collaborating with teams of other technology departments (SAP, SharePoint, etc.) to integrate platforms and taking care of the onboarding of new team members. After the first year, he shifted to an inhouse software engineering project. The project consistent of deploying a managed service platform able to run custom Deloitte applications for external clients. The first part was developing a custom Python framework to easily deploy and maintain network infrastructure on AWS. The second part of this project was setting up applications on the servers on the platform in an automated way, using Puppet code and bash scripts. The servers were mostly Linux. Kasper is used to working with git (Gitlab for this project) as a versioning tool. Afterwards, Kasper worked on statistical models in the financial sector. Here he combined code development with statistics and algorithms to create credit risk models, using SQL (Oracle) for data preparation and a custom wrapper of the Kedro framework (Python) for model development. Both scikit-learn and statsmodels models were use. Coding was done on a Linux environment with git (Bitbucket) as the versioning tool and Jenkins for CI/CD. Next to the technical knowledge gained at Deloitte, he learned how to work towards goals, the importance of clear communication towards colleagues and clients and working on a project as a team. During the Covid pandemic, working remotely became the standard."

Smart contracts were written in Solidity and the Truffle suite was used for testing and deployment. Web3.js was used to provide a node command line interface to operate the smart contract functions as an administrator, and also for front-end integration in react. I was responsible for the technical advice on business requirements and smart contract implementation. Other tasks are doing research on technical topics (e.g. gas war mitigation, staking, reflection principle,...), contract testing (locally and on test nets), creating a PoC for the front-end integration, contract deployment on test and main nets and perating deployed contracts as owner."

He was working on proof of concepts for blockchain-based solutions, mainly regarding secure data sharing and crypto wallets in a corporate environment. Most of the applications were using RESTful API’s in Flask (Python). Testing was done using the Pytest framework. Databases were either AWS DynamoDB or relational databases. AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateways were used as infrastructure, using the Serverless framework for deployment of the different microservices. Github was used for version control, Github actions for CI/CD. The teams worked in agile sprints, managed in Jira. Client-side libraries were written in Javascript as input for the front-end work (which was mostly outsourced). Besides the tasks mentioned before, Kasper worked on onboarding new team members, testing the front end, assess threat modelling, creating demos of the solutions, perform code reviews on pull request written by colleagues, writing high-quality documentation and perform threat modelling."
