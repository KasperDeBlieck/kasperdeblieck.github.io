# Kasper's resume repo

Hi, this repository contains a React application with some information about myself. Huge shout out to Tim Baker, as the code is based on his [react-resume-template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template).

The goal of this repository is to give you an idea of who I am and what I do.

The build is saved in the `docs` folder for Github pages compatibility.
